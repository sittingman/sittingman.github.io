# About Me:

### Why Data Science?
Since I started out as a finance/accounting professional, I always look for projects which allow me to identify "efficiency", be it process improvement that save labor hours, or bundling purchases to save money. I like finding "optimal" solution for problems. After 5 years in the field, I transitioned into supply chain/inventory planning, which present limitless opportunities on finding saving. Then I hit the bottleneck on solving those problems, because each problem composes of numerous variables, and the combination of the variables easily multiple up the potential outcome, which I had a hard time to model out through excel.

This is the moment when the concept of machine learning being introduced to me, which allows me using programming languages to solve complex problems, leveraging proven algorithm to simulate results. I see this as the Swiss Army knife of hacking problems in almost any business problem that I am facing everyday, and decided to commit into this field as my long term career path.
