## Why Data Science?
I always look for projects which allow me to identify “efficiency”, be it process improvement that saves labor hours, or forecasting spending decision to to save money. I enjoy seeking the “optimal” solution for problems. 
<br>
We are exposed to huge volume of data like never before, the opportunity of finding efficiency become limitless. Data Science is the wonderful tool to comb through layers of data to identify the "golden eggs" within. Thanks to user friendly programming languages like Python, I can combine my business experience and be self sufficient on tackling problems with Big Data.
